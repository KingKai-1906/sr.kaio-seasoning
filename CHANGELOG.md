# Sr. Kaio Seasoning - Changelog

## Release 4.4.2
> 2021/03/07

Update to match TPF 4.4.2 release and to do a little cleanup: JK's interiors and PraedithXVI staves got the boot!

The interiors were more hassle than gain for me and the staves need some improvement, maybe they'll be readded in the future.

After updating the seasoning for 4.4.2, you'll need to regen Nemesis and AllGUD steps.

This update is save safe! :)
