# sr.kaio-seasoning

As an enthusiast of The Elder Scrolls universe and of Phoenix's majestic Skyrim SE guide, [The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com/), I've decided to try my luck with some aspects of the modding guide life.
  
But as I lack the time and expertise to curate and mantain a full-fledged guide, I thought about doing something less than a full one, thus the idea of *seasoning* came to light.
  
A *seasoning* is just a small follow-up guide to point-wise changes, just to polish a guide to personal tastes, without harming its core idea and without making the users have a chore to make these changes. It's less than a fork, since it depends on the main guide.
  
So, here's my first one, **Sr. Kaio Seasoning for TPF**, enjoy!
